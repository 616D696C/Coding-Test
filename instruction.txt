# Ruby version 2.0.0
# libraries used: nokogiri and open-uri

I used Ruby v2.0.0 since this is the latest compatible version for the library nokogiri. 
The library Nokogiri will do the parsing on the URL fetched by the library open-uri.

The moment you run the program, you will be ask to choose a country name on the available currency conversion list for US Dollar. I only entered a few countries just to test if the program is working and so that it won't take too much time to load.

The countries are Norway, China, Philippines, Russia and Japan. If you input a value, it will then check if what you inputted is found in the list of countries. If its not then the program will print a string that says "No currency rate available for this country". If yes, then it will go to a loop and find the currency conversion of US Dollar to that country you inputted. The loop will stop the moment your country is found and display that conversion.

Inputting the name of the country is not case-sensitive. Therefore you can input NORwaY and it will get the currency conversion of US Dollar for Norway.
